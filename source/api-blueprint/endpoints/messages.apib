## Messages [/messages/{message_id}]

A message is a resource which can be either received or sent via an inbox. Messages are grouped by conversations.

A message can be either inbound (received) or outbound (sent). You can know if a message has been received or sent thanks to the boolean `is_inbound`.

Each message has a type depending on the channel it has been sent with:

| Type name    | Description                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| `email`      | Email message                      |
| `tweet`      | Message from Twitter               |
| `sms`        | SMS message                        |
| `smooch`     | Message from Smooch                |
| `facebook`   | Message from Facebook              |
| `intercom`   | Message from Intercom              |
| `call`       | Phone call                         |
